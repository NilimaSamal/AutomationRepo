webdriver.chrome.driver

The ChromeDriver consists of three separate pieces. 
There is the browser itself ("chrome"), the language bindings provided by 
the Selenium project ("the driver") and an executable downloaded from the 
Chromium project which acts as a bridge between "chrome" and the "driver". 
This executable is called "chromedriver", but we'll try and refer to it as
 the "server" in this page to reduce confusion.
